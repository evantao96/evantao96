## Hi, I am Evan Tao ##

I studied computer science at UPenn and currently teach AP Computer Science at a high school in NYC.

Computer science education is one of my interests, but I also enjoy working with databases, networked systems, machine learning and computer vision. Currently, I am working on visualizing a large-scale network of NBA players.

Aside from programming, I like to run. My next races are the Fred Lebow Half Marathon in NYC and the Seville Marathon in Spain.
