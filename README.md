# Hi, I am Evan Tao #

I studied computer science at UPenn and currently teach AP Computer Science in NYC. 

## About Me ## 

I have been teaching computer science for 5 years at Central Park East High School, a small school in East Harlem.

My primary interests are web indexing, databases, networked systems, computer vision and computer science education.

Aside from programming, I like to run. My next races are the Fred Lebow Half Marathon in NYC and the Seville Marathon in Spain.
