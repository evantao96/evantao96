## Hi, I am Evan Tao ##

I studied computer science at UPenn and currently teach AP Computer Science at Central Park East High School, a small school in East Harlem.

Computer science education is one of my interests, but I also enjoy working with databases, networked systems, machine learning and computer vision.

Currently, I am working on visualizing a network of NBA players using the GraphStream Java library, and building a front-end in Vue.js that demonstrates stages of computational face recognition. 

Aside from programming, I like to run. My next races are the Fred Lebow Half Marathon in NYC and the Seville Marathon in Spain.
