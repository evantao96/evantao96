## Hi, I'm Evan Tao ##

I studied computer science at UPenn and currently teach AP Computer Science at Central Park East High School, a small school in East Harlem.

Computer science education is one of my interests, but I also enjoy working in databases, networked systems, machine learning and computer vision.

Aside from programming, I like to run. My next races are the Fred Lebow Half Marathon in NYC and the Seville Marathon in Spain. 

## I'm Currently Working On ##

- Visualizing large-scale networks using the GraphStream Java library
- Building a dynamic front-end that visualizes stages of face recognition in the brain
- Completing Advent of Code 2023
